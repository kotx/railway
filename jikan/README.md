# Jikan

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/ciVW-C)

This is a Jikan configuration compatible with Railway.
I spent way too long on this because Apache is horrible. Enjoy.

Set the [Jikan configuration](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan-rest/blob/master/.env.dist) (normally in .env) using environment variables instead.
